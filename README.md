# Car Landing Page with React.js

This project is a **responsive car landing page** created using **React.js** and **Vite**. The goal of this project was to practice React fundamentals and learn how to build visually engaging, interactive websites.

## 🚗 Project Overview

The landing page features:

- A **navigation bar** with sections: `CarName`, `Home`, `About`, `Explore`, and `Contact`
- A **background slideshow** with **three images** that change every 3 seconds (`3000ms`)
- Each image displays a **catchy sentence** overlayed
- **Dot indicators** at the **bottom-left** show which image is currently displayed
  - The active dot is highlighted in **orangered**
- A **video toggle button** is placed at the **bottom-right**
  - Clicking the icon will **play or pause** the video
  - While the video is playing, the background images are hidden
  - A **fade-in effect** appears when the video starts
